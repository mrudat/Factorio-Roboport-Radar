Intended for use with [Brave New World](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/brave-new-world).

Provides [Coverage](https://wiki.factorio.com/Radar#Coverage) for a roboport's construction area.

This is achieved by adding a radar to each roboport that [Charts](https://wiki.factorio.com/Radar#Charting) all chunks within the roboport's construction radius once every 3 seconds.

The added radar does not perform [Long Range Survey Scanning](https://wiki.factorio.com/Radar#Long_Range_Survey_Scanning), you will need a real radar for that.
